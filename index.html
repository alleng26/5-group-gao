                        <p>According to anthropologist Josh Bell, the lack of face-to-face interaction is depersonalizing the way we communicate with one another.
                            Through the screen, there is an absence of vulnerability that would be there in a face-to-face interaction and has changed human sociology
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Ira Hyman, a professor of psychology at Western Washington Universtiy, says that hones don’t necessarily make people more or less social. Something that most people are taking notice of is how they change the way that we interact with each other. They make people talk differently and act differently based off of what they do on their phone.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Hyman also finds that when people are out with their friends they tend to check social media. A study found that 74% of females check their phones at least 10 times when they’re out with friends, comparing to males at 54%.</p>

                        <p>In a Kent State Study, researchers found that females used texting and calling to feel emotionally close to their friends and family, whereas for many males, the use of technology did not relate to emotionally connecting to people.</p>

                        <p>The study concluded that the use of phones at inappropriate times out of habit had a negative effect on the emotional closeness with peers and parents</p>

                        <p>Interviewing local high school students, we found that phones have become a larger part of day to day life, although not taking it over for most. Students also say that face to face interaction has not been changed since the beginnings of social media.</p>

                        <p>Students tend to find both positives and negatives with the growing use of technology and social media. It is a great way to stay connected to friends and family, especially if they live far away. It is a great way to stay up to date with the news, and the convenience of technology nowadays has made obtaining information and staying connected much easier.</p>

                        <p>Technology does not only bring benefit to teens, but it can bring cyberbullying, rumors, and confrontation. It can also take up too much time outside of school, and extracurricular activities. Also, sometimes it may feel like talking to someone through a screen can replace face to face conversation.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Based off of our research we found that, as much as cell phones can help us in our daily lives, they do end up ruining real conversations, and relationships. Some people spend more time on their phone than actually talking to someone, or trying to get to know someone. When someone takes out their phone during a conversation the conversation just starts to deteriorate until there is nothing left.</p>
            
            <p>With all the new technology and forms of cummunication, our idea of being social is definitely changing, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but we think that our traditional idea of interaction and communication is important to us as humans.</p>
